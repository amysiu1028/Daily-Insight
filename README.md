## üí° Project Overview
Create a news reader application that fetches articles from the News API. The app should allow users to browse a list of articles with headline, image, description (if present), and date. Additionally, implement a detailed view for each article with headline, image, date, content, and source. The list of articles should link to a detailed view within the app (not to the source website). Implement some form of search, filter, or sort functionality for a better user experience. The application should be responsive and usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## üöÄ Features
- Display a list of articles with headline, image, description (if present), and date.
- Implement a detailed view for each article with headline, image, date, content, and source.
- Link articles in the list to a detailed article view within the app.
- Include search, filter, or sort functionality for improved user experience.
- Ensure the application is responsive and works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## üìù Development Notes
- During development, use mock data to limit actual requests (considering the API's request limit).
- For demonstration/evaluation, make live requests to the News API.
- Prioritize features for MVP and ensure a clean, well-thought-out codebase.
- Consider basic usability practices and standards, maintaining a clear hierarchy of information.

## üîß Setup
1. **Clone the repository:** Open a terminal window. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository: `git clone (git@github.com:yourusername/NewsReader.git)`
2. **Install the dependencies:** Run the following command in the cloned repository directory: `npm install`
3. **Run the React app:** Run the following command in the cloned repository directory: `npm start`
4. **Open the app in your web browser by navigating to:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üßê Evaluation
Things we'll be looking for:
- Strong understanding of React JS and Front-End best practices.
- Ability to prioritize for MVP.
- Understanding of basic usability practices and standards.
- Clear hierarchy of information in the user interface.
- Clean, well-thought-out code with attention to detail.
- Consideration of user needs and a user-friendly news feed.

## ‚è∞ Time Management
Try to limit your total time to around 8 hours on this project. Prioritize what is important to get the feed working and as close to MVP as possible. Remember, we're looking for clean code and problem-solving skills, not a fully-fledged newspaper website. Focus on a user-friendly and functional news reader.
